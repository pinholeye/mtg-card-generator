# mtg-card-generator

mtg-card-generator is a tool for creating custom Magic the Gathering cards based on a generative model. <br>

This project was written as a final project of a Machine learning course at Jagiellonian University, Cracow. <br>
The main aim of this project was to learn more about generative models and machine learning as a field of study. As a bonus to wirte a program to generate a set of at least 360 different cards for the "cube" format. Those cards will be printed and draft played on 01.04.2022 in a group of 8 people.
